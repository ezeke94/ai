    <p>Hi there, I am Prerak. I am passionate about studying human behavior, helping people, and I am also an enthusiast about technology.</p>
    <p>I have a master's degree in clinical psychology and have experience as an educator for 3 years. I love dogs and video games.</p>
    <p>I made this website as a personal project. Many people have approached me with questions related to approaching counseling or therapy for the first time.</p>
    <p>Not only is there a shortage of awareness and resources, but therapy or counseling can also get very expensive.</p>
    <p>This project acts as a stepping stone for people to become aware of counseling and facilitate their growth.</p>
    <p>The code for this website has been written with the help of AI.</p>
