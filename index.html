        <p>I am Prerak Arya, a passionate individual with a deep interest in understanding human behavior and helping others. With a master's degree in clinical psychology and three years of experience as an educator, I possess a strong foundation in psychology and the ability to connect with people.</p>
        <p>As a technology enthusiast, I believe in leveraging technology to make a positive impact on people's lives. My website, Cup of Mind, is a personal project aimed at raising awareness about counseling and therapy. Through this platform, I strive to provide valuable resources and guidance to individuals who are considering therapy for the first time.</p>
        <p>The field of therapy often lacks sufficient awareness and accessibility, with the cost of counseling being a barrier for many. Cup of Mind acts as a stepping stone for individuals seeking counseling, offering them an understanding of the process and facilitating their personal growth.</p>
        <p>Feel free to reach out to me via email to discuss any questions or inquiries you may have. I look forward to connecting with you.</p>
